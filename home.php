						<li>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.</li>
            <li>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</li>
            <li>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.</li>
            <li>The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).</li>

              <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
              <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
              <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
              <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>

              <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>

						<p>According to medical experts, vaccination is one of the most efficient public health interventions. The World Health Organisation (WHO) says that immunisation or vaccination shields a person from life-threatening diseases such as polio, tetanus, and diphtheria and lowers the risk of spreading diseases to others. Vaccines have proven to be successful in eradicating diseases such as smallpox and polio. Vaccines trigger the body's own immune system to act and safeguard the individual against the subsequent infections, say experts. Dr Vishal Sehgal, Medical Director, Portea Medical says that about 2-3 million deaths can be prevented every year globally with proper immunisation.</p>

            <h1>Common Myths About Vaccination Busted By Experts</h1>
            <b><p>Myth: Vaccines can cause severe side-effects like autism in children and even death</p></b>
            <strong>FACT:</strong><p> This is one of the most common myths around vaccines among a lot of people, said Dr Vishal Sehgal, Medical Director, Portea Medical. According to him, autism has been falsely linked with some vaccines MMR (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella) vaccine but a number of studies have been undertaken that have proved that there is no association between immunisation and autism. He said that such rumours get wind because in most cases, children are diagnosed with autism around the same time as their immunisation schedule. He further asserted that vaccinations do not cause any fatal disease or death. Side-effects of vaccines are rare and mild that include fever or slight pain in the area where the vaccine was administered but these wane away soon, he said.
            </p>
            <b><p>Myth: Vaccines are not required, maintaining proper hygiene is enough to protect from viruses</p></b>
            <strong>FACT:</strong><p>Experts say that while maintaining proper hygiene and sanitation will ensure a better standard of life and reduce the risk of infection, it will not protect against such infectious diseases that can spread despite cleanliness and good living conditions. Dr Sehgal said that delaying or denying vaccination will make people vulnerable to a number of infection.</p></b>

            <b><p>Myths: Administering vaccines during pregnancy may harm mother, child or both</p></b>
            <strong>FACT:</strong><p>Fact: Dr Sehgal asserted that immunisation is a part of preventive medical care and is important for pregnant women to protect the health and life of both - woman and baby.</p>

            <b><p>Myths: Adults do not need to get vaccines</p></b>
            <strong>FACT:</strong><p> Vaccines are helpful at all stages of life- right from infancy to childhood to adult life and old age, said Dr Sehgal. He added, 'Adult vaccination is not so common in India but it really needs to become a part of our public healthcare system as the adults too need protection from various deadly diseases like human papillomavirus vaccine, hepatitis A and B, pneumococcal among others. Our senior citizens who are very susceptible to pneumonia and must be given the pneumococcal vaccine. Rubella vaccination is given to females who are of reproductive age group. The human papillomavirus vaccine is given to prevent cervical cancer in women. Then there are also travel immunisation which people should take while travelling to other countries. Like Indian citizens travelling to Africa should take the yellow fever vaccine. Similarly, vaccination against disease like typhoid, tuberculosis can be taken while travelling to European countries.
            </p>

            <b><p>Myth: Once I receive the COVID-19 vaccine, I no longer need to wear a mask.</p></b>
            <strong>FACT:</strong><p>Masking, handwashing and physical distancing remain necessary in public until a sufficient number of people are immune.</p>
